/** \defgroup pw_registry Registry
 *
 * The registry object is a singleton object that keeps track of
 * global objects on the PipeWire instance. See also \ref pw_global.
 *
 * Global objects typically represent an actual object in PipeWire
 * (for example, a module or node) or they are singleton
 * objects such as the core.
 *
 * When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
 * will emit a global event for each global currently in the
 * registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device hotplugs or
 * reconfiguration or other events, and the registry will send out
 * global and global_remove events to keep the client up to date
 * with the changes.  To mark the end of the initial burst of
 * events, the client can use the pw_core.sync methosd immediately
 * after calling pw_core.get_registry.
 *
 * A client can bind to a global object by using the bind
 * request.  This creates a client-side proxy that lets the object
 * emit events to the client and lets the client invoke methods on
 * the object. See \ref page_proxy
 *
 * Clients can also change the permissions of the global objects that
 * it can see. This is interesting when you want to configure a
 * pipewire session before handing it to another application. You
 * can, for example, hide certain existing or new objects or limit
 * the access permissions on an object.
